Changelog:

* Fix stray debug message

* Work on the optimizer - still not stable (Gopal, Ilia, Sara)

* Performance boost - Replace multiple loops over the opcode
  array with a single loop for copying, jump fixups and auto
  global pre-fetches. (Gopal)

* Perform fetch_global checks only in php5 and only if 
  auto_globals_jit is enabled. (Gopal)

* Fix bug #8579 - scrub php4 classes' function_table and default
  properties before inserting into cache. (Gopal)

* Fix bug #8606 - ZEND_FETCH_GLOBAL is not an opcode, but is a 
  op1->type.  The opcodes applicable are ZEND_FETCH_R and 
  ZEND_FETCH_W. (Gopal)

* PHP 5.2 Compatibility (Gopal)

* Make the include_once override optional - default off (Sara)

* Fixed crash when apc run in CLI, but enable_cli is off. (Ilia)

* Ensure that the apc_globals->cache_stack is cleared before the 
  shm cache is destroyed. Fixes segfault for corner-case i.e request
  shutdown (apc_deactivate) is not called before module shutdown 
  calls (php_apc_shutdown_globals)  (Gopal)

* TSRM fixes (ensure ts_free_id before apc.so is dlclosed) (Gopal)

* Fix memory leak of apc_cache_info_t->deleted_list (Gopal)
