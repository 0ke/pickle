Changelog:

 - Reduce usage of CG(open_files) (mkoppanen at php dot net)
 - Add support for php-trunk, new op code, new internals string format, etc. (Dmitry)
 - apc_debug are not compiler-valid NOPs for non-debug builds

 - Fixed relative paths resolution when ./foo/a.php or ../foo/a.php (or similar path) 
   are used. 'foo/a.php' path behaviors remain unchanged
 - Fixed a possible memory corruption, when partial path cannot be resolved 
   by expand_filepath()
 - Fixed notices in apc.php (Tomasz Krawczyk)

 - Fixed Bug #17978: standardize user keys to include NULs in identifier_len. Z_STRLEN_P() doesn't, so add to it.
 - Fixed bug #16966, apc produces tons of warnings "Unable to allocate memory for pool".

 - Added --enable-apc-debug configuration argument to enable debugging (Kalle)
 - Added support for internal debugging on Windows (Kalle)
 - ZTS optimizations (Kalle)
