Changelog:

* Made --enable-apc-mmap the default compile option (for real this time)

* Add an optional flag to apc_cache_info() and some apc.php tweaks to make it
  only fetch header information to make it useful when you have tens of
  thousands of entries.  (Brian Shire)

* 64-bit fixes (George)

* Don't mix Full Path and Inode keys (George)

* Override ZEND_INCLUDE_OR_EVAL opcode (when possible) to speed up use of
  require_once() and include_once() statements. (Sara)

* Add a non-blocking write_lock for cache inserts.  This is a better approach
  to prevent cache slams and deprecates the slam_defense setting. (Rasmus)

* A bit of work on the optimizer.  (Sara)

* Various memory issues resolved. (Gopal)
